# Space Dodge 100 

This is a game for the [GitHub 2017 GameOff](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017).

## Running

This game uses [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) (in particular version 0.10.2).

To run:

* Clone it
* Run `love .` in the directory with `main.lua`

## Controls

Use left, right, up, down arrow keys or WASD to move.

## Background

A long time ago I was given a [TRS-80 Model 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_100).
I spent a ton of time [learning how to program it](https://twitter.com/presidentbeef/status/879844518987571200) and writing little programs in its dialect of BASIC.

One of the games I recall making was like this one - flying through blocks that you have to avoid. In particular, the blocks moved in a discrete fashion down the screen, which allowed you to time your moves.

This game is intended to look and feel similar to (how I remember) playing that game on the Model 100.

Note: the "spaceship" is not part of the Model 100 character set, so I did cheat there.
